# CS426HW4

Written by Zachary Robbins

Physic Constructs:
1. Mice are now bouncy. When they are collided with, they jump in the air and bounce, so the player must quickly catch them before the mice get disabled again.
2. Upon correct collision between a mouse and a target, the target now generates fancy rune particles

Lights:
All sections of the CPU now have colored lights lightly illuminating them. In addition, the mice also generate lights now. WHite to show they were startled, and red to show they are vulnerable.

Billboard: added a new billboard at the beginning giving a rough idea of the new features mentioned above

The following features fit into my original design by increasing the challenge of the game by making mice harder to grab and the area in general harder to navigate. In addition, these new additions do not sacrifice the core gameplay loop of taking mice to different sections of the computer and depositing them.
